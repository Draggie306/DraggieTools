- More colours available!
    - Note: This is a test version and there is additional printing to the console. Debug level logs are printed to the console. This will be removed in the next version.
- Improved speed of initialisation
- All network events not initialised by external libraries now are more easily accessible with the log name "LilyNetworking"
- Log functions can now be called with parameters "event" and "component"
    - "event" overwrites text colours, with "success", "warning" or "error" having their respective colours
    - "component" is the name of the component of the program that is logging the event, e.g. "lily" (networking) will be logged as "[LilyNetworking]"
- Logs generated now have lower amounts of colour coding as a result from the CLI

[BankFileExtractor]
- Fixed a bug which resulted in errors due to the new logging system. 
- Bank files are now extracted successfully.
