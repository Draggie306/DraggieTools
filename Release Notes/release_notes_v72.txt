- New strings.
- Colours! In parts of the CLI, you'll be greeted with new colourful text.
    - These changes are purely cosmetic and help to distinguish between regular information, warnings, errors and other types of messages.
    - Colours are mostly in recent parts of the program like Saturnian and Lily. Older parts of the program will be updated in the future.
    - Parts of the program with fully implemented colours are magenta in the main menu!
- New command prompt mode. This allows you to execute console commands without having access to CMD.exe itself.
    - This is useful for when you're in a restricted environment and you need to execute a command.
- Logging has been improved and is now more consistent - all messages printed to the console are now logged to a file.
- Fixed glitchy text after downloading files.
